    <p>
        Alfajor cake is made with layers 
        of shortbread-like cookies and 
        dulce de leche cream - simply delicious!
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>½ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 (13.4 ounce) can dulce de leche</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup powdered sugar, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
     </ul>
    
     <ol>
        <li><p> 
            butter with a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on 
            medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sugar and beat 
            until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of bowl as needed, 
            about 2 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating until incorporated 
            after each addition, about 30 seconds.</p></li>
        <li><p>
            Whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a 
            medium bowl until combined. Add flour mixture to butter mixture in 
            3 additions, alternating alternately with the milk, starting and 
            ending with the flour mixture, and beat until combined after each 
            addition.</p></li>
        <li><p>
            Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and turn to coat dough. 
            Knead dough 2 or 3 times. Divide dough into 5 equal pieces and shape 
            each piece into a ball. Working with 1 ball at a time, roll dough 
            into a 7-inch circle. Place dough circles on 2 large rimmed baking 
            sheets lined with parchment paper (I fit 3 circles on 1 sheet and 2 
            on the other). Chill dough circles, uncovered, for 1 hour.</p></li>
        <li><p>
            Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prick each dough 
            circle lightly with a fork.</p></li>
        <li><p>
            Bake in the preheated oven until browned on bottom and light 
            browned around the edges, 15 to 18 minutes. (If baking in 2 batches, 
            keep second batch refrigerated while first batch bakes.) Cool cake 
            layers completely on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>
            Spoon dulce de leche into a medium bowl. Beat cream with an 
            electric mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 
            6 minutes. Gently stir half of cream mixture into dulce de leche 
            until combined. Gently fold remaining cream into dulce de leche 
            mixture until combined.</p></li>
        <li><p>
            Spread 1/3 cup of the dulce de leche mixture onto 1 cake layer,
             spreading to edges. Place onto a serving platter with dulce de leche
              mixture facing up. Repeat process with the next 3 cake layers 
              (this is easier to spread on cake layers before placing on platter). 
              Spread remaining 2/3 cup dulce de leche mixture onto fifth cake 
              layer and place on top. Let stand 1 hour. Dust top of cake with 
              powdered sugar and serve. Cover any leftovers with plastic wrap and 
              store in refrigerator up to 1 day.</p></li>
