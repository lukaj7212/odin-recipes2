    <p>
        Rough puff is buttery and flaky, 
        but maybe not quite as flaky as puff pastry. 
        This dough is not sweet and can be paired 
        with something savory or sweet—think tarts, 
        hand pies, palmiers, etc.
    </p>
   
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>½ cup cold water</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>

        <li><p>
            Place flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a 
            paddle attachment. Add butter and toss with your fingertips until 
            evenly coated with flour. Add water to bowl. Mix on low speed until 
            the dough forms a shaggy mass, about 45 seconds.</p></li>
        <li><p>
            Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until butter is 
            firm but not brittle, about 20 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>
            Transfer dough to a floured work surface and roll into a 
            1/2-inch-thick rectangle that is about 10 1/2 x 6 inches. Fold 
            one third of the longer side of the dough over the center 
            third of dough. Fold the final third over the center (like you
             would fold a letter). Tightly wrap folded dough in plastic wrap
              and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes. Repeat this 
              process of rolling, folding and refrigerating 4 more times, 
              turning the dough 90 degrees each time before rolling.</p></li>
        <li><p>
            After completing the final fold, wrap the dough tightly in 
            plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or 
            up to 2 days.</p></li>

    </ol>
